# Zombieland

A set of extensions for [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) to test web applications from the initial request to the client side scripts.

- [Little Rock](https://github.com/BonnierNews/zombieland/blob/main/packages/little-rock/README.md) - A layout module for emulating anything visual.
- [Tallahassee](https://github.com/BonnierNews/zombieland/blob/main/packages/tallahassee/README.md) - A browser module for loading pages, containing subsequent requests, persisting cookies etc.
- [Wichita](https://github.com/BonnierNews/zombieland/blob/main/packages/wichita/README.md) - A resource module for running client side JS and resolving assets.
- ? - Any other key features?

> Would be nice with at least 4 core modules so that all main characters are represented


## TODO

- [ ] Sleek, consistent APIs for all modules
- [ ] Separate submodules to separate packages
- [ ] Forward JSDOM exports
